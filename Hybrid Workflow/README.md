
These notebooks demonstrate how you can apply hybrid solvers to your problem, create hybrid workflows, and develop custom hybrid components. Notebook 01 will start you off with Leap's cloud-based hybrid solvers and out-of-the-box dwave-hybrid samplers and workflows, and requires only familiarity with the binary quadratic model (BQM) approach to formulating problems for solution on quantum computers. Notebook 02 shows how you create your own workflows using existing dwave-hybrid components. Notebook 03 is aimed at developers interested in developing their own hybrid components for optimal performance.
